# Playing With Docker Environment Variables

There's going to be a blog post accompanying this on my website shortly.

Although this is now written for Go, it was originally written in Java. I started with Java as that is the language I'm most comfortable in. I then switched up to Go because I'm trying to learn it.

If you want to see the Java version checkout commit [18c8a60](https://github.com/mrnickel/Experiments-DockerEnvs/commit/18c8a60f14cd9e0f33613c80cd3bc6a6148eab48)
